# WorldQuant-University-Projects


This repository consist of interactive python notebooks for my training and miniprojects for the World Quant University Applied Data Science module

The Applied Data Science module is built by [Worldquant University](https://wqu.org/)â€™s partner, The Data Incubator, a fellowship program that trains data scientists.

The module consists of two units which spans over 8 weeks each: 

- **Unit I:** [Scientific Computing and Python for Data Science](https://github.com/yemisiajao/WorldQuant-University-Projects/tree/main/WQU-DS-Unit1)
- **Unit II:** Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis

Across both units in the module, students gain a comprehensive introduction to scientific computing, Python, and the related tools data scientists use to succeed in their work. Students will develop machine learning and statistical analysis skills through hands-on practice with open-ended investigations of real-world data.
